   - Tissue biopsies (e.g., skin, lung, liver, or kidney biopsies)<br>
   - Cancer diagnosis and staging<br>
   - Inflammatory and infectious disease analysis<br>
   - Special staining techniques<br>

4. **Cytology**  <br>
   Cytology involves the study of cells from body fluids or tissue samples to detect abnormalities, including cancer. Our cytology services are especially important in the early detection of cancer and other diseases. Common tests include:<br>
   - Pap smears for cervical cancer screening<br>
   - Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies<br>
   - Sputum and urine cytology<br>
   - Pleural fluid and ascitic fluid analysis<br>

5. **Biochemistry**  <br>
   Our biochemistry lab plays a critical role in diagnosing and monitoring various metabolic and endocrine conditions. We perform a wide range of tests, including:<br>
   - Lipid profile (cholesterol and triglycerides)<br>
   - Hormone testing (thyroid, reproductive, and adrenal hormones)<br>
   - Enzyme analysis (e.g., liver enzymes, cardiac enzymes)<br>
   - Electrolyte balance testing<br>
   - Vitamin and mineral deficiency testing<br>

6. **Genetic Testing**  <br>
   We offer advanced genetic testing services that help diagnose hereditary conditions, genetic disorders, and certain types of cancers. These tests can also provide insights into treatment options and help in assessing risks for family members. Services include:<br>
   - Genetic screening for inherited disorders<br>
   - Cancer genetic testing<br>
   - Carrier screening for genetic diseases<br>
   - Prenatal genetic testing<br>

7. **Serology**<br>
   Serology tests help detect antibodies and antigens in blood samples, providing valuable information about infections, autoimmune diseases, and vaccination status. Our serology tests include:<br>
   - HIV and Hepatitis testing<br>
   - Blood typing and crossmatching<br>
   - Rheumatoid factor and autoimmune screening<br>
   - Infectious disease screening (e.g., malaria, dengue, COVID-19)<br>
